# Competitive-Programming

## Overview
This repository is based on **_Competitive Programming's Handbook_** by **Antti Laaksonen**.

The book consists of **3 main chapters**:
1. Basic Techniques
2. Graph Algorithms
3. Advanced Topics

The details for each chapter can be seen [Here](docs/Chapters.md).

<!-- 
However, this repository focuses on the practical implementations of the following two chapters:

Chapter 2: Predicate Logic
- This section leverages Alloy, a tool for modeling and analysis, to implement predicate logic. Alloy's advantages allow us t0 study intricate systems and create instances for examination and study of logical restrictions and properties.

Chapter 3: Verification by Model Checking
- This section utilizes NuSMV, a tool for model checking, particularly in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). NuSMV is an excellent tool for enabling system behaviors, detecting faults during the design phase, and evaluating finite state systems against temporal logic specifications. -->
